# Next.js 15 App Rendering Issue in Development Mode

This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 15 where an application renders correctly in production but exhibits unexpected behavior in development mode. The issue specifically affects the rendering of the main application component.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Observe the unexpected behavior in the browser.
5. Run `npm run build` and `npm run start` to start the production server.
6. Observe that the application renders correctly in production.

## Potential Causes

The root cause of this issue is still under investigation, but it might be related to:

* A conflict between Next.js 15's internal mechanisms and a specific development environment setup.
* An incompatibility between the application code and a recent Next.js 15 update.
* An overlooked configuration setting that only manifests in development mode.

## Solution

The solution, as provided in `index.solution.js`, may involve:

* Adjusting environment variables.
* Updating or downgrading package versions.
* Modifying the application code to account for differences between development and production environments.
